# MyReads Project

The MyReads project is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and
 categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The
 book database is served by a Backend server by Udacity.

The project is live [here](https://b00kshelf.herokuapp.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Installing the project
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Run the project
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a
particular set of search terms, which can be found in
[SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that
 will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket
 Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
